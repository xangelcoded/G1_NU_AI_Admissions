üß† G1 NU AI Admissions ‚Äî Enrollment & Re-Enrollment Prediction

A Flask web app for school admissions that predicts a student‚Äôs likelihood to enroll or re-enroll using a stacked ML pipeline (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost ‚Üí Meta-model).
Large ML artifacts are not committed to Git; they‚Äôre fetched from Google Drive into app/AIMODEL/ during setup.

A great README is part of your grade: GitHub itself recommends every repo ship with one, describing what the project does, how to run it, how to contribute, and how to stay secure.

For .gitignore, use the official Python template from GitHub‚Äôs maintained collection so you don‚Äôt accidentally commit caches, venvs, or secrets.

Prerequisites

Python 3.10+

Git

(Optional) Ollama installed if you want LLM explanations

Quickstart
1) Clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>

2) Virtual environment
# Windows (PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS / Linux
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

3) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


We pin scikit-learn to a compatible version because cross-version loading of pickled models is unsupported and risky; use the same versions used during training. 
scikit-learn.org
+1

4) Configure environment

Create your local config file:

cp .env.example .env


Open .env and set values:

# Flask / DB
SECRET_KEY=change-me
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///school.db
DATABASE_NAME=school.db
DEBUG=True

# Email (Gmail): use an App Password (with 2-Step Verification)
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-digit-app-password

# ML
MODELS_DIR=app/AIMODEL

# LLM (optional)
OLLAMA_MODEL=gemma:1b


python-dotenv reads .env and exports variables for your app, keeping secrets out of code and version control. 
PyPI

For Gmail SMTP, generate an App Password (with 2-Step Verification) instead of using your main password. 
GitHub

5) Get the ML models (Google Drive)

Option A ‚Äî One-command download (recommended):

pip install gdown
mkdir -p app/AIMODEL
gdown --folder "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tWb2rTPgFtyRndK6hi2Rq4Px36sYHiLQ?usp=sharing" -O app/AIMODEL


gdown --folder "<share-url>" -O <output-dir> pulls the entire shared folder into app/AIMODEL.

Option B ‚Äî Manual:

Open the Drive link in a browser

Download files and place them in app/AIMODEL/:

meta_model.pkl

rf.pkl

lr.pkl

xg.pkl

training_columns.pkl

X_train_encoded.pkl (if required by your code)

6) (Optional) Enable Ollama
# Install Ollama (see official site) and pull a local model
ollama pull gemma:1b


Update OLLAMA_MODEL in .env if you prefer another local model.

7) Run the app
python app.py


The app starts at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
 (or the host/port configured in your code).

API Reference

cURL example

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/register \
  -F firstName=Juan -F lastName=DelaCruz -F dateOfBirth=01/15/2005 \
  -F sex=Male -F emailAddress=juan@example.com -F password=pass123 \
  -F student_ID=2025-0001 -F campus=Main -F academic_year=2025-2026 \
  -F academic_term=1 -F course_1st=BSCS -F course_2nd=BSIT \
  -F curr_region=Region4A -F curr_province=Laguna -F curr_city=Calamba \
  -F per_country=Philippines -F per_region=Region4A \
  -F per_province=Laguna -F per_city=Calamba \
  -F student_type=New -F school_type=Public \
  -F last_school_attended="Calamba Sci HS"

POST /login

Fields: emailAddress, password

Response: session cookie is set if successful.

GET /delete/<id>

Deletes a user by numeric ID. (Use with caution in demos.)

Data Dictionary (Key Fields)

User: id, emailAddress, password_hash, created_at

Record: id, student_ID, demographics (age/sex/addresses), program choices, school history, likelihood (float), label (string), confidence (string), explanation (text), timestamps

Your exact columns may vary; check app/model/user.py in your repo for the source of truth.

Reproducibility & Model Compatibility

Pin versions of ML libraries used to train your models (e.g., scikit-learn, xgboost).

Important: Loading a pickled scikit-learn model trained under a different version is not supported and can fail silently or at load time. Keep runtime versions equal to training versions. 
scikit-learn.org

Troubleshooting

Models not found / load error

Confirm files exist in app/AIMODEL (or set MODELS_DIR in .env).

Ensure your scikit-learn version matches the training environment (we pin in requirements.txt). Cross-version pickle load is unsupported. 
scikit-learn.org

Gmail SMTP fails

Use a Gmail App Password (requires 2-Step Verification). Regular account passwords won‚Äôt work with modern SMTP auth. 
GitHub

Sessions not sticking in local dev

Keep DEBUG=True for local HTTP. In production, run under HTTPS and set secure cookie flags.

gdown --folder doesn‚Äôt fetch files

Make sure the Drive folder is shared as ‚ÄúAnyone with the link can view‚Äù and then rerun the command. gdown supports folder URLs/IDs for bulk download. 
CommandMasters

.env variables aren‚Äôt loading

Verify the file is named .env and located at the project root. python-dotenv reads key=value lines and exports them before Flask initializes. 
PyPI

Development Tips

Keep secrets in .env; never hardcode credentials. python-dotenv implements this cleanly and follows 12-factor practices. 
PyPI

Start your repo with a README and a proper .gitignore. Use GitHub‚Äôs official Python template so you don‚Äôt leak venvs or caches. 
GitHub Docs
+1

If you need to add screenshots, drop them in a docs/ folder and reference them with Markdown.

Security

Never commit .env, database files, or model binaries.

Prefer App Passwords + 2FA for Gmail SMTP. 
GitHub

License

Add a license (MIT is common for student projects). A license clarifies reuse for reviewers and classmates.
